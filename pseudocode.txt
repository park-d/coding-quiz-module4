Pseudo code

- when you start the quiz, the first questions pops up onto the screen and the above elements excep timer and high scores disappear
    - when you hover the answers, they highlight
    - when you click the answer, it shows if you are right or wrong, then switches to the next question.
    - if you are wrong, it subtracts 15 seconds from the timer. 
    - At the end of the quiz, your score is displayed, you input your initials and save that to the high scores page.
- you can view the highscores at any time, and it saves the scores in the local storage
