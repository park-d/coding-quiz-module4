# Module-4 Challenge: Web APIs - Code Quiz

## Description

In order to help familiarize myself with coding assessments and to use the skills covered in the most recent bootcamp module regarding Web APIs, I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Usage

Application deployed at the following link: https://park-d.github.io/coding-quiz-module4/

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

When a user opens the page, they are presented with an introduction page with instructions, a start button, and a link to view highscores. When the users clicks the "Start Quiz" button, they are taken to the first question in the quiz and a timer starts. If the user answers the question correctly, the button displays "Correct!" and a green background. If the user answers the question incorrectly, the button displays "Incorrect!", a red background, and subtracts 15 seconds from the timer. When the user answers all of the questions, or the timer hits 0, the game ends. The user can then enter their initials to save and submit their score to the scoreboard page. The user can view the scoreboard page at any time, and can clear the scores from the scoreboard page. See example quiz walk through below.
